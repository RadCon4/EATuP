## Project-2---EATuP

### Synopsis
***

Food.  Friends.  Fast.

Sometimes, you just can't decide where you want to eat. Whether you are by yourself or want to get together with friends. Feel like something familiar, but can't decide? EATuP allows you to keep track of your favorite places and recommend an option. Want to try something completely new in your area? EATuP will give you a recommendation. Want to include your friends? Once you have decided on the where, you can input their phone numbers and EATuP will text them with your choice.

#### Technology Incorporated
***

We developed this app around a MySQL database.

We used a Passport-Local strategy for unique User login, creation, and storage through .ejs pages to the mySQL database.

We used Bootstrap 4 in the creation of our html pages.

We used the Yelp-Fusion API as the open source data for our app.

We used the following Node packages:
	
    * bcrypt-nodejs
    * body-parser
    * bootstrap
    * connect-flash
    * cookie-parser
    * ejs
    * express
    * express-session
    * font-awesome
    * geolib
    * jquery
    * jquery.easing
    * morgan
    * mysql
    * mysql2
    * passport
    * passport-local
    * save
    * sequelize
    * twilio
    * yelp-fusion (our open data source for restaurants)
  
The page is deployed on Heroku here:

#### Future Wish List
***

We would like to incorporate the following functionality in the future:

	* Node Mailer package for email updates.
	* A mobile device friendly layout.
	* We have a functional Geolocator that we would like to incorporate.
